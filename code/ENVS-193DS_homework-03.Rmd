## Part 2

```{Problem 1}
#I could group my data based on ranges of hours since my last leg workout (e.g., 0–12, 12–24, 24–48, 48+ hours) and calculate the mean vertical jump height within each group. This would help me see if more recovery time improves performance, since fatigue or muscle recovery could directly influence jump height.
S
# change name of table
df <- ES193DS_jump

# Rename the nasty column for clarity
df <- df %>%
  rename(
    RecoveryHours = `Time since last leg workout (hours)`,
    JumpHeight = `Highest Vertical Jump (inches)`
  )

# Create bins for recovery time
df <- df %>%
  mutate(RecoveryGroup = cut(RecoveryHours,
                             breaks = c(0, 12, 24, 48, Inf),
                             labels = c("0–12 hrs", "12–24 hrs", "24–48 hrs", "48+ hrs"),
                             right = FALSE))

# Summarize by group
summary_df <- df %>%
  group_by(RecoveryGroup) %>%
  summarise(MeanJump = mean(JumpHeight, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = RecoveryGroup, y = JumpHeight)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, color = "#2ca02c", size = 2, alpha = 0.6) +  # individual points
  geom_point(data = summary_df, aes(y = MeanJump), color = "#ff7f0e", size = 4) +  # mean points
  geom_line(data = summary_df, aes(x = RecoveryGroup, y = MeanJump, group = 1), 
            color = "#ff7f0e", size = 1) +  # straight line between means
  labs(
    x = "Recovery Time Since Last Leg Workout",
    y = "Vertical Jump Height (inches)", 
    caption = "Individual jump heights are shown in green. Orange points and the line represent the mean vertical jump height for each recovery group."

  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 11)


# Summarize and round the data
summary_df <- df %>%
  group_by(RecoveryGroup) %>%
  summarise(`Mean Jump Height (inches)` = round(mean(JumpHeight, na.rm = TRUE), 1))

# Create the gt table
summary_df %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Mean Vertical Jump by Recovery Time Group"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    RecoveryGroup = "Recovery Time Group"
  )

```

```{r Problem 2}
#Problem 2
#Training vertical jump sometimes feels like climbing a mountain. Some days you see progress dip while other days you reach unprecedented heights. I could have a linear graph of date on the x axis and vertical jump on the y axis. Days where I have a have a higher soreness index could be red while days where I feel fresh are shaded green. This would help visualize how I've progressed over time and also the ups and downs of training.
