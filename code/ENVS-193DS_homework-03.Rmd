```

## Part 2

```{Problem 1}
#I could group my data based on ranges of hours since my last leg workout (e.g., 0–12, 12–24, 24–48, 48+ hours) and calculate the mean vertical jump height within each group. This would help me see if more recovery time improves performance, since fatigue or muscle recovery could directly influence jump height.

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
